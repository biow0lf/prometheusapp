                <abbr title=\"Independent ALT Linux development team\">ALT&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;Team</abbr>.
                Participation in Sisyphus project is open for anyone. This
                project is based upon software packaging and dependency
                tracking technologies as well as robust developer collaboration
                processes. Any ALT&nbsp;Linux distribution and <b>APT</b>
                package manager is sufficient to use Sisyphus. Sisyphus is a
                solution set constantly being under development which can be
                used to create universal or specialized <b>Linux distributions</b>
                or just <b>single systems</b>.
                <br /><br />
                Sisyphus is not intended for end users and its usage may result
                in unpredictable behaviour. You might want to use ALT&nbsp;Linux
                distributions and their usual updates if you want to run a reliable system."

      header: "Project Prometheus"
      text: "<b>Prometheus</b> project is an attempt to create analytic site for developers and users of
             Sisyphus repository.<br /><br />

             It is useful for developers due to ability to more closely interoperate with other
             developers and users of respective packages.  This site is especially valueable
             to new ALT Linux Team members. It gives answers \"who is who\", \"who does what\",
             \"what status is\" in interesting field.<br /><br />

             Sisyphus users can get full information about a package beforehand. There are
             handy links (site of origin, ALT Linux specific issues, wiki, etc.).<br /><br />

             The project is useful for ALT Linux Ltd. and ALT Linux core team too, as it gives
             information about Sisyphus development, strong and weak aspects, actively
             supported and used groups of packages.<br /><br />

             Another nice property of the project is posibility to use it together with
             any other package repository snapshot (not only Sisyphus itself), for local
             development within a small group or even one's self."
